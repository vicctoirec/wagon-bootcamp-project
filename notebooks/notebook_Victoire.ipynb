    "    1. Uncertainty and Doubt\n",

    "        âShould I give up? Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere.â\n",

    "    2. Love vs. Rationality\n",
    "        Adele expresses the tension between emotional conviction and logical thinking. She knows itâs love but questions if itâs worth continuing:\n",
    "        âThis ain't lust, I know this is love, but if I tell the world I'll never say enough.â\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Fear of Waste and Futility\n",
    "        There is a strong fear that continuing the pursuit might be pointless or a waste of effort:\n",
    "        âOr would it be a waste? Even if I knew my place, should I leave it there?â\n",

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible You drift into my head And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race, If you want me to stop I'll freeze, And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby, And make me crazy for you. Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin. I wish you'd come over, Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you, Strips me down bare And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away, But the more I do, The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors, Hoping you'll walk through And save me boy, Because I'm too crazy for you.

      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI have analyzed Adele's lyrics and identified the following top 5 recurring themes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Heartbreak and Loss:** This is perhaps the most prominent theme in Adele's music. Many of her songs explore the pain, sadness, and regret that come with the end of a relationship.\n",
      "    *   \"Hello from the other side / I must've called a thousand times / To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done\" (Hello)\n",
      "    *   \"Never mind, I'll find someone like you / I wish nothing but the best for you, too\" (Someone Like You)\n",
      "    *   \"Didn't I give it all? Tried my best / Gave you everything I had, everything and no less\" (Take It All)\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Regret and Apology:** Often intertwined with heartbreak, Adele's lyrics frequently express regret for past actions and a desire to apologize or make amends.\n",
      "    *   \"I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness / And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head\" (Don't You Remember)\n",
      "    *   \"I should probably tell you now before it's way too late / That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face\" (River Lea)\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Longing and Yearning:** Many of Adele's songs convey a sense of longing for a lost love or a past relationship, and a yearning to reconnect or rekindle what was lost.\n",
      "    *   \"I miss you when the lights go out / It illuminates all of my doubts\" (I Miss You)\n",
      "    *   \"When will I see you again? / You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said\" (Don't You Remember)\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Moving On and Forgiveness:** While heartbreak is a common theme, Adele's songs also touch on the process of moving on, forgiving oneself and others, and finding the strength to let go.\n",
      "    *   \"I'm giving you up / I've forgiven it all / You set me free, oh\" (Send My Love (To Your New Lover))\n",
      "    *   \"I braved a hundred storms to leave you / As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down\" (Turning Tables)\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Nostalgia and Memories:** Adele often reflects on the past, reminiscing about childhood, old friends, and the way things used to be.\n",
      "    *   \"Round my hometown / Memories are fresh / Round my hometown / Ooh the people I've met / Are the wonders of my world\" (Hometown Glory)\n",
      "    *   \"Everybody loves the things you do / From the way you talk / To the way you move / Everybody here is watching you / Cause you feel like home\" (When We Were Young)\n",
